  <p>This website used to be able to solve the Wordle of the day, enabling you to always get the answer on the first try. However, after the New York Times bought Wordle, they updated the code, randomizing the answers and making it impossible (as far as I can tell) to predict the answer without actually doing the puzzle. The solver is still present on this website, but it will not work. </p>
